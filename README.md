# Card with States for Power BI

Hacked to have a "Budget with %" under the Category option and to allow for user color coding against this budget (i.e. green is good, red is bad). Need to disable Card States for this work.

This was done as the existing Power BI KPI card text was way too small.


Based on the Power BI built-in Card and KPI, the Card with States by OKViz allows you to bind a performance measure and to define multiple states that determine the color of the visual itself. Moreover, you can set a trend axis to display a the measure trend line. It is customizable in every single aspect.
